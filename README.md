# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

NLP has the goal of deiving information out of natural language (could be sequence text or speech).

Another common term for NLP problems is sequence to sequence problems (seq2seq).

Natural language is a broad term but you can consider it to cover any of the following:

Text (such as that contained in an email, blog post, book, Tweet)
Speech (a conversation you have with a doctor, voice commands you give to a smart speaker)
NLP Flow:

`Text -> turn into numbers -> build a model -> train the model to find patterns -> use patterns (make predictions)`

The dataset we're going to be using is kaggle's introduction to NLP dataset (text sample of tweets labelled as disaster or not)
